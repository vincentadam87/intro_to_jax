# Intro to Jax for the [Bamb!2022](https://www.bambschool.org/) summer school.

This repo contains Python notebooks training simple models via (stochastic) gradient descent.
The example notebooks use the Python library [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and its neural network library [stax](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/main/jax/example_libraries/stax.py)

Models include: 
* linear regression  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vincentadam87/intro_to_jax/blob/main/notebooks/Linear%20Regression%20-%20with%20and%20without%20JAX.ipynb)
* logistic regression [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vincentadam87/intro_to_jax/blob/main/notebooks/Logistic%20Regression%20-%20with%20JAX.ipynb)
